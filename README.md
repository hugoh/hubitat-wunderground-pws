# Hubitat Weather Underground Personal Weather Station Driver

This is a device driver for getting weather information from a personal weather station via [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com).

In order to work, you need to specify a [Weather Underground API key](https://www.wunderground.com/member/api-keys) and, of course, a weather station to get data from.

In addition to retrieving the latest observation, it also computes the average temperature over a specified number of hours, which was inspired by [Gary Milne's NWS data driver](https://github.com/GaryMilne/Hubitat-Apps/).
